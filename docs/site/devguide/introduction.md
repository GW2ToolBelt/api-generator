# Developer Guide

The purpose of the developer guide is to get your acquainted with the internals
of the project. This is the right place if you want to get know how
api-generator itself works. If you are interested in using api-generator in one
of your projects, read the [user guide](../userguide/introduction.md) instead.

!!! note

    Getting familiar with the basics of api-generator by reading the [user guide](../userguide/introduction.md)
    before looking into the internals is strongly recommended.


## Project Structure
