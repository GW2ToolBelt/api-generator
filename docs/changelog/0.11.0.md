### 0.11.0

_Not Released Yet_

#### Improvements

- Added support for strings formats to encode additional semantic properties of a string's contents via the
  `SchemaString.format` property. [[GH-461](https://github.com/GW2ToolBelt/api-generator/issues/461)]
  - ISO-8601 timestamps and UUIDs are now properly marked as such and can now be mapped to more appropriate types.

#### Fixes

    - `/v2/characters/:id/inventory`:
        - Bag slots are now marked as nullable. [[GH-544](https://github.com/GW2ToolBelt/api-generator/issues/544)]
