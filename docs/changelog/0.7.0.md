### 0.7.0

_Not Released Yet_

#### Improvements

- Added a `SchemaBitfield` type to be used for bitfields. This type should
  always be mapped to 64bit integers.
- Introduced the concept of inlined properties for reference types.
  - Inlined properties can be used to group elements into logical units without
    affecting the serial representation.

#### Fixes

- Endpoints:
  - `/v2/account`:
    - Fixed the optionality of `build_storage_slots` for tokens without `BUILDS`
      scope.
- Changed the type of `worldID` in the `MumbleLinkIdentity` to `BITFIELD`.
