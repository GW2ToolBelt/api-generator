# User Guide

The api-generator library is intended to be used at build-time to generate
software libraries or applications that interface with the Guild Wars 2 API.
This user guide is designed to make you familiar with the API of api-generator.

## Installation

api-generator requires Java 8 (1.8) and Kotlin 1.8 or later.

The library is published to [Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.gw2tb.api-generator/api-generator)
with the coordinates `com.gw2tb.api-generator:api-generator` and can be consumed
just like any other Java or Kotlin library directly from your build tool. No
additional setup is required.
