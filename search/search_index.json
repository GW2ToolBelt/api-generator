This library contains information about the structure and data-types of the API. This information can be used to generate custom API clients or other programs which require definitions of the API. This library requires Java 8 or later. (Keep in mind that this library is intended to be used for static code-generation only. This requirement is not relevant for the generated output.) The Guild Wars 2 API \u00b6 Authentication \u00b6 Some API endpoints provide account-specific data. To query these endpoints, an API key must be passed to authenticate. Further, each API key has a custom set of permissions which determine what information can be retrieved using the key. An API key may be passed along a request by using the access_token query parameter, or using the Authorization: Bearer ${API Key} request header (recommended). E.g. https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/account/inventory?access_token=${API Key} returns the shared inventory of the key's owner iff the key has the ACCOUNT and INVENTORY permissions. Localization \u00b6 The Guild Wars 2 API supports localization (but the actual supported languages differ based on the API version). Language API v1 API v2 Chinese (zh) - \u2714 English (en) \u2714 \u2714 French (fr) \u2714 \u2714 German (de) \u2714 \u2714 Spanish (es) \u2714 \u2714 Localized data can be accessed by setting the lang query parameter to the language code. (The API makes some effort to guess the language based on your IP geolocation. Hence, it is recommended to always request a language explicitly for consistent results.) E.g. use https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?id=43766&lang=en to request english information: { \"name\": \"Tome of Knowledge\", \"description\": \"Grants one character level if below level 80 or one spirit shard if level 80.\\nOnly usable in PvE and WvW.\", \"type\": \"Consumable\", \"level\": 0, \"rarity\": \"Exotic\" // additional fields were excluded from this example } and https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?id=43766&lang=de to request german information: { \"name\": \"Foliant des Wissens\", \"description\": \"L\u00e4sst Euren Charakter eine Stufe aufsteigen, wenn er Stufe 80 noch nicht erreicht hat, oder gew\u00e4hrt eine Geister-Scherbe, wenn er auf Stufe 80 ist.\\nNur im PvE und WvW verwendbar.\", \"type\": \"Consumable\", \"level\": 0, \"rarity\": \"Exotic\" // additional fields were excluded from this example } Query Types \u00b6 Generally, API endpoints are structured in two different ways: There are 1. \"blob\"-style endpoints which return just return all relevant data (e.g. /v2/build ) and 2. indexed endpoints which return indices for many datums (e.g. v2/items ). Indexed endpoints provide a couple of different parameters to retrieve the data for a given set of IDs. These are referred to as QueryTypes throughout documentation and source of this project. Possible query types are: - querying IDs (e.g. /v2/items ), - querying by ID (e.g. /v2/items?id={id} ), - querying by IDs (e.g. /v2/items?ids={ids; \",\"-separated} ), and - querying by page (e.g. /v2/items?page={index}&page_size={size} ). Querying by IDs \u00b6 Some endpoints support a specialized version of this query type that can be used to retrieve all datums at once (e.g. /v2/legends?ids=all ). Querying by Page \u00b6 When querying by page, the response contains additional header elements: - x-page-size which is the requested page size, - x-page-total which is the total amount of pages for the given size, and - x-result-count which is the number of results on the returned page. Usage \u00b6 Generating implementations \u00b6 The library defines several entry-points for retrieving all the information necessary to generate implementations for each API version: - com.gw2tb.apigen.APIVersion.API_V1 , - com.gw2tb.apigen.APIVersion.API_V2 and the data exposed by Guild Wars 2 via MumbleLink: com.gw2tb.apigen.MumbleLink.MUMBLELINK_IDENTITY_DEFINITION . These entry-points expose the types and queries supported by the API. Types are defined as \"schema types\" - an abstraction that contains necessary information about the structure of the APIs data-types. It is recommended to generate a one-to-one mapping between schema mappings and appropriate language or library constructs. For a better understanding of schema types and how to work with them, please refer to the user guide . Building from source \u00b6 Setup \u00b6 This project uses Gradle's toolchain support to detect and select the JDKs required to run the build. Please refer to the build scripts to find out which toolchains are requested. An installed JDK 1.8 (or later) is required to use Gradle. Building \u00b6 Once the setup is complete, invoke the respective Gradle tasks using the following command on Unix/macOS: ./gradlew <tasks> or the following command on Windows: gradlew <tasks> Important Gradle tasks to remember are: - clean - clean build results - build - assemble and test the Java library - publishToMavenLocal - build and install all public artifacts to the local maven repository Additionally tasks may be used to print a list of all available tasks. Adding/modifying endpoints \u00b6 From time to time endpoints are added or updated. These changes need to be manually integrated into the API definition . The API definition files use a custom DSL for defining endpoint that attempts to be as concise as possible while also providing the additional benefits of type-safety. Adding a new endpoint is as simple as adding a few lines of Kotlin code to the appropriate file. For example, the /v2/build endpoint looks as follows: \"/Build\" { summary = \"Returns the current build ID.\" schema(record(name = \"Build\", description = \"Information about the current game build.\") { CamelCase(\"id\")..\"ID\"(INTEGER, \"the current build ID\") }) } Each endpoint definition must contain a summary describing what the endpoint does, and a schema which defines the shape of the returned data. For further information on which functions to use in what situations, please refer to the documentation of the developer guide .
